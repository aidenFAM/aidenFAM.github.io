    <article><h2>About Me</h2></article>
    <p>My name is Aiden Famili, and I am currently a student in the <em>Interactive Media Design</em> program
         at <strong>Algonquin College</strong>.
        I love many sports such as basketball (<abbr title="National Baksketball Association">NBA</abbr>), 
        hockey, and <abbr title="Formula 1">F1</abbr>; as well, I enjoy playing sports when the weather is nice.
         When I am on my computer, I enjoy photo manipulating, video editing, and video creating.
         I am very intrigued but nervous to learn new content in this program such as coding.
          For this first assignment however, learning <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> sounds like fun.<br>
            </p>
            <p> This is my 1<sup>st</sup> time coding in my life, therefore, I have mixed feelings about this course. So far, 
                I took <em><abbr title="Communications Technology">Com-Tech</abbr></em> throughout my years at high school,
                 learning all about digital art, cameras, effects, e.t.c. To me, coding is like learning a new language, it can 
                 be exciting but as well challenging, which I accept. <br> </p><br>
